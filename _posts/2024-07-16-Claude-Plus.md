# Claude Plus : AI-Powered Development Assistant

I built an AI development assistant, currently a work in progress but give it a try. 

Claude Plus is an advanced AI-powered development assistant that combines the capabilities of Anthropic's Claude AI with a suite of development tools. It's designed to help developers with various tasks, from coding to project management, all through an interactive chat interface.

## Features

- üß† **Interact with Claude-3.5-Sonnet**: Engage with the advanced AI, ask to build your ideas and code files and folders are made!.
- üìÅ **File System Manipulation**: Claude will create, read, write and delete files and folders seamlessly on your system. The files tab shows date modified and size of files and folders in a list or grid view. 
- üîç **Powerful Search**: Utilize Tavily API or SearXNG to perform comprehensive searches. Claude also has search tool built in.
- üí° **Code Snippet Management**: Highlight and manage code snippets efficiently. Have questions about an existing project drop the folder in the projects directory and Claude will have full access. 
- üìÇ **Project Structure Management**: Build and maintain complex project structures with ease.

### 3. Project Structure Management

- **File Explorer**: Use the intuitive file explorer interface to manage your project structure directly in the UI.
- **Create**: Add new files or folders to organize your project.
- **Edit**: Modify existing files with syntax highlighting for various programming languages.
- **Delete**: Remove unnecessary files or folders to keep your project clean.
- **Real-time Updates**: All changes in the file explorer are immediately reflected in the `projects` folder.

### 4. Automode for Autonomous Development

- **Activate Automode**: Enable Claude to work autonomously on complex tasks or entire project setups.
- **Project Generation**: Describe a project idea, and watch as Claude creates folder structures, files, and boilerplate code.
- **Iterative Development**: Claude can refine and expand code over multiple iterations without constant user input.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor Claude's progress as it works through tasks in automode.
- **Sandbox Environment**: All automode operations are confined to the `projects` folder, ensuring safe experimentation.

## Docker

This project includes a Docker configuration

### Docker quick start 

Set your .env correctly in root

cd into docker folder 

```yaml
docker-compose up -d
```
Frontend: http://localhost:5173

You can always get the latest image by:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/bigsk1/claude-plus:latest
```

### Local Docker Setup

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Build and run the development containers:

   ```
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
   ```

4. Access the application:

   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173

The development setup includes hot-reloading for both frontend and backend, and maps the `projects` folder to persist data.


## VS Code Dev Container Setup

This project also includes a configuration for development using VS Code's Remote - Containers extension.

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code
- Docker Desktop
- Remote - Containers extension for VS Code

### Setup

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container", or use the Command Palette (F1) and select "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container".
3. VS Code will build the dev container and reload the window with the project open inside the container.

### Features

- Python 3.12 and Node.js 18 pre-installed
- All project dependencies automatically installed
- Pre-configured linting and formatting tools
- Automatic port forwarding for backend (8000) and frontend (5173)
- Unified development environment across different machines

### Usage

Once inside the dev container:

1. The backend server will start automatically on port 8000.
2. The frontend development server will start automatically on port 5173.
3. You can edit files as normal, and changes will be reflected immediately due to volume mounting.
4. Use the integrated terminal in VS Code to run additional commands if needed.

Note: The first time you open the project in the dev container, it may take a few minutes to build. Subsequent loads will be much faster.
