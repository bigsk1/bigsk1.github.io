# Voice Chat AI üéôÔ∏è

Voice Chat AI is a project that allows you to interact with different AI characters using speech. You can choose between various characters, each with unique personalities and voices. Have a serious conversation with Albert Einstein or role play with the OS from the movie HER.

You can run all locally, you can use openai for chat and voice, you can mix between the two. You can use ElevenLabs voices with ollama models all controlled from a Web UI. Use different chat providers like Anthropic, xAI, Ollama, OpenAI.

WebRTC Real Time API with OpenAI you can have a real time conversation, interrupt the AI and have instant responses. You can also use OpenAI's new TTS model gpt-4o-mini-tts to make the AI more human like with emotions and expressive voices.
