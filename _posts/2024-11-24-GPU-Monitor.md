### For Content Creators
Monitor rendering jobs without constantly checking task manager. Get notified when renders complete or if your GPU is struggling.

### For Gamers
Keep an eye on temperatures during intense gaming sessions. Perfect for overclocking experiments or optimizing game settings.


## Pro Tips
- Set custom alert thresholds based on your GPU's specs
- Use browser notifications for headless setups
- Check historical data to identify performance patterns
- Monitor power efficiency for optimal workloads

## Quick Start

Test to see if you already have the requirements and ready to use. 

```bash
sudo docker run --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus all ubuntu nvidia-smi
```
If this failed proceed to [Installation Prerequisites](#installation-prerequisites)



### Using Pre-built Image

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name gpu-monitor \
  -p 8081:8081 \
  -e TZ=America/Los_Angeles \
  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  -v ./history:/app/history \
  -v ./logs:/app/logs \
  --gpus all \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  bigsk1/gpu-monitor:latest
```
Note: Update your timezone to use the correct time
### Using Docker Compose

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bigsk1/gpu-monitor.git
cd gpu-monitor
```

2. Start the container:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Access the dashboard at: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)



## Installation Prerequisites


### 1. Ubuntu / Debian / WSL  
Windows users make sure you have wsl with docker an easy way is [Docker Desktop Installation for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)
 
Installing with apt add NVIDIA package repositories

```bash
curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \
  && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | \
    sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
```

### 2. Install nvidia container toolkit

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
```

### 3. Configure Docker with toolkit

```bash
sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker
```
The nvidia-ctk command modifies the /etc/docker/daemon.json file on the host. The file is updated so that Docker can use the NVIDIA Container Runtime.


### 4. Restart Docker daemon

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### 5. Test to see if installed correctly

```bash
sudo docker run --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus all ubuntu nvidia-smi
```


For other distributions, check the [official documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html).


## Building gpu-monitor from source

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bigsk1/gpu-monitor.git
cd gpu-monitor
```

2. Build the image:

docker build -t gpu-monitor .
```

3. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name gpu-monitor \
  -p 8081:8081 \
  -e TZ=America/Los_Angeles \
  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  -v ./history:/app/history \
  -v ./logs:/app/logs \
  --gpus all \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  gpu-monitor
```

## Configuration

The dashboard is accessible at: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
 by default. To change the port, modify the `docker-compose.yml` file or the `-p` parameter in the docker run command.

## Alternative Setup Method

A setup script is provided for convenience. It checks prerequisites and manages the service:

- If you have issues then make sure `setup.sh` is executable

```bash
chmod +x ./setup.sh
```

---
- Check prerequisites and start the service
```bash
./setup.sh start
```
---
- Stop the service
```bash
./setup.sh stop
```
---
- Restart the service
```bash
./setup.sh restart
```
---
- Check service status
```bash
./setup.sh status
```
---
- View logs
```bash
./setup.sh logs
```

Example of script running
```bash
~/gpu-monitor ./setup.sh start

Creating network "gpu-monitor_default" with the default driver
Creating gpu-monitor ... done
[+] GPU Monitor started successfully!
[+] Dashboard available at: http://localhost:8081
[+] To check logs: docker-compose logs -f
```


## Data Persistence

By default, all data is stored within the container will persist between container rebuilds, if you don't want that then remove volumes, modify the docker run or docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
services:
  gpu-monitor:
    # ... other settings ...
    volumes:
      - ./history:/app/history    # Remove Persist historical data
      - ./logs:/app/logs    # Remove Persist logs
```

## Alerts

You can enable or disable alerts in ui, you can set thresholds for gpu temp, gpu utilization % and watts. Setting are saved in your browser if you make changes you only need to do it once, however you can always modify the code and rebuild the container to make it permanent.

The defaults are: 

```bash
    temperature: 80,  
    utilization: 100,
    power: 300
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **NVIDIA SMI not found**
   - Ensure NVIDIA drivers are installed
   - Verify NVIDIA Container Toolkit installation
   - Make sure you can run:  

```bash
sudo docker run --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus all ubuntu nvidia-smi
```
If this failed proceed to [Installation Prerequisites](#installation-prerequisites)

2. **Container fails to start**
   - Check Docker logs: `docker logs gpu-monitor`
   - Verify GPU access: `nvidia-smi`
   - Ensure proper permissions

3. **Dashboard not accessible**
   - Verify container is running: `docker ps`
   - Check container logs: `docker logs gpu-monitor`
   - Ensure port 8081 is not in use
4. **TimeStamps don't match your local time**

    - Replace `America/Los_Angeles` with your timezone
[List of tz database time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)

5. **I don't like the alert sound**
    - Replace the .mp3 in the `sounds` folder and name it alert.mp3
    - Getting double sounds from notifications, disable windows notifications or disable it in ui.
