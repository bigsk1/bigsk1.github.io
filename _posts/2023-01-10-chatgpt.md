## Introduction to ChatGPT 

ChatGPT is a computer program that can talk like a human. It can understand what you say and respond to you just like a friend would. Imagine you have a robot friend that you can talk to and ask it questions and it can answer you back! It's like having a magical talking computer!

The more complex explaination is ChatGPT is an open-source conversational language model based on the GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) architecture, it's been trained to predict the next token in a conversational context.

In this post, we'll explore how ChatGPT can be used in a chatbot application.

## Generating Responses with ChatGPT

Here is an example of how you might use the model to generate a response to a user's message in a chatbot application:
```python
import openai_secret_manager

# Get API key
secrets = openai_secret_manager.get_secret("openai")
api_key = secrets["api_key"]

# Use the API key to create a session with the API
import openai
openai.api_key = api_key

# Use the session to generate a response to the user's message
prompt = (f"Your message")
completions = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="text-davinci-002",
    prompt=prompt,
    max_tokens=1024,
    n=1,
    stop=None,
    temperature=0.7,
)

# Print the generated response
message = completions.choices[0].text
print(message)

```
If you head over to <a href='https://chat.openai.com'>ChatGPT</a> and sign up you can start testing some of it's features. It's free. Just start asking it?, I guess it's an it, some questions.
