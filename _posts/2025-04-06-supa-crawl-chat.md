## Database Connection Options

The project supports two ways to connect to your Supabase database:

1. **Single URL** (Option 1):
 Use this for both local and remote connections. The URL can be specified with or without protocol.

   ```bash
   # With protocol (for remote instances)
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co:5432
   
   # Without protocol (for local instances)
   SUPABASE_URL=192.168.xx.xx:54322
   ```

You'll need to provide the database credentials:

   ```env
   SUPABASE_DB=postgres
   SUPABASE_KEY=postgres
   SUPABASE_PASSWORD=postgres
   ```

### Content Chunking for LLM Interaction

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>
The system automatically breaks down large content into smaller, more manageable chunks for better LLM interaction and more precise search results. This provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Search Precision**:
 Instead of matching against entire pages, the system can find the specific chunk that best answers a query.

2. **Efficient Token Usage**:
 When interacting with LLMs, only the relevant chunks are sent, reducing token usage and costs.

3. **Better Context Management**:
 Each chunk maintains a reference to its parent page, preserving the full context.

4. **Automatic Token Limit Handling**:
 Content is automatically chunked to stay within the token limits of the embedding model (8,192 tokens for text-embedding-3-small).
</details>

### How Chunking Works

<details>
<summary>Click to expand chunking details</summary>

The system uses a sophisticated semantic chunking strategy:

1. **Semantic Boundary Detection**:
 Content is first split along natural semantic boundaries:

   - Markdown headers (e.g., `# Section Title`)
   - Paragraph breaks
   - This preserves the meaning and context of each chunk

2. **Token-Based Sizing**:
 Each section is then analyzed to ensure it fits within token limits:

   - Sections that fit are kept together
   - Sections that exceed limits are further split with token-based chunking
   - A 200-token overlap is maintained between chunks for context continuity

3. **Smart Overlap**:
 When creating overlaps between chunks, the system looks for natural break points:

   - Paragraph breaks
   - Sentence endings
   - Clause breaks
   - Word boundaries

4. **Metadata Preservation**:
 Each chunk maintains references to:

   - Its parent document
   - Its position in the sequence (chunk index)
   - Its token count

This approach ensures that chunks are not only sized appropriately for LLMs but also maintain semantic coherence, making them more useful for search and retrieval.
</details>

### Configuring Chunking

<details>
<summary>Click to expand chunking configuration</summary>

You can adjust the chunking parameters in the code:

```python
# In crawler.py, enhance_pages method
enhanced_pages = asyncio.run(self.enhance_pages(pages, max_tokens_per_chunk=4000))
```

The default settings are:

- `max_tokens_per_chunk`: 4,000 tokens (half of the 8,192 token limit for safety)
- `overlap_tokens`: 200 tokens (overlap between chunks to maintain context)
</details>

## Testing the Setup

Before using the crawler, you can test your setup:

1. Test the database connection:

```bash
python tests/test_db_connection.py
```

2. Test the Crawl4AI API:

```bash
python tests/test_crawl_api.py
```

## Usage

### Setting up the database

Before using the crawler, you need to set up the database:

```bash
python main.py setup
```

This will create the necessary tables and extensions in your Supabase database.

## Terminal

</details>


### Crawling a website with args

<details>
<summary>Click to expand website crawling options</summary>

You can crawl a website in two ways:

1. Using the command-line interface:

```bash
python main.py crawl https://example.com --name "Example Site" --description "An example website"
```

   To crawl a sitemap:

```bash
python main.py crawl https://example.com/sitemap.xml --sitemap --name "Example Site"
```

   You can limit the number of URLs to crawl from the sitemap:

```bash
python main.py crawl https://example.com/sitemap.xml --sitemap --max-urls 20
```

   Note: If you don't provide a description, the system will automatically generate one based on the content of the homepage or main page.

2. Using the `.env` file configuration: ( recommended )
   
   First, update the `.env` file with your crawl settings:

```env
CRAWL_TYPE=url  # or 'sitemap' for sitemap crawling
CRAWL_URL=https://example.com
CRAWL_SITE_NAME=Example Site
CRAWL_SITE_DESCRIPTION=An example website  # Optional - will be auto-generated if empty
```

   Then run:

```bash
python run_crawl.py
```

</details>


### Title and Summary Generation

The crawler automatically generates titles and summaries for crawled content using OpenAI. You can configure the model used for this in the `.env` file:

```bash
OPENAI_CONTENT_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

#### Updating Existing Content

<details>
<summary>Click to expand content updating options</summary>

If you have existing pages without titles or summaries, or if you want to regenerate them with a different model, you can use the `update_content.py` script:

```bash
# Update all sites
python update_content.py

# Update a specific site
python update_content.py --site-id 1

# Limit the number of pages to update
python update_content.py --limit 50

# Force update all pages, even if they already have titles and summaries
python update_content.py --force
```

</details>

### Searching the crawled content

<details>
<summary>Click to expand search options</summary>

To search the crawled content using semantic search:

```bash
python main.py search "your search query"
```

To use text-based search instead of semantic search:

```bash
python main.py search "your search query" --text-only
```

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/806c80ae-1fbf-4680-990e-9d2b9b3bbaa8)

To adjust the similarity threshold and limit the number of results:

```bash
python main.py search "your search query" --threshold 0.8 --limit 2
```

To save the search results to a file:

```bash
python main.py search "your search query" --output results.json
```

</details>

### Listing crawled sites

To list all the sites that have been crawled:

```bash
python main.py list-sites
```

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7fce24d-50e8-447e-8900-15ffcb56ce92)

By default, this only counts parent pages (not chunks). To include chunks in the page count:

```bash
python main.py list-sites --include-chunks
```

### Working with Chunks

<details>
<summary>Click to expand details on working with chunks</summary>

When retrieving or searching content, you can control whether chunks are included:

```python
# Get pages for a site (parent pages only)
pages = crawler.get_site_pages(site_id, limit=100)

# Get pages for a site including chunks
pages_with_chunks = crawler.get_site_pages(site_id, limit=100, include_chunks=True)
```

When searching, chunks are automatically included and prioritized for more precise results. Each chunk includes context about its parent document:

```python
python main.py search "your search query"
```

The search results will include:
- The content snippet that matched your query
- Which document it came from
- Which part of the document it represents (e.g., "Part 2 of 5")

This makes it easier to understand the context of each search result, even when it's a small chunk of a larger document.

### Using the chat interface in terminal

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34d79a96-2d60-4221-a1f7-3a8582129855)


The project includes a chat interface in the terminal that uses an LLM to answer questions based on the crawled data. The chat interface now supports persistent conversation history, allowing the LLM to remember previous interactions even after restarting the application.

You can start the terminal chat interface using either the dedicated script or the main CLI:

```bash
# Using the dedicated script
python chat.py

# Using the main CLI
python main.py chat
```

#### Chat Interface Options

<details>
<summary>Click to expand chat interface options</summary>

You can customize the chat interface with various options:

```bash
# Specify a different OpenAI model
python main.py chat --model gpt-4

# Set the maximum number of search results to retrieve when chatting
python main.py chat --limit 10

# Adjust the similarity threshold for vector search (0-1)
python main.py chat --threshold 0.6

# Use a specific session ID for persistent conversations
python main.py chat --session my-chat-session

# Associate the conversation with a specific user
python main.py chat --user John

# Enable verbose debug output
python main.py chat --verbose

# Combined
python main.py chat --model gpt-4 --limit 15 --threshold 0.3 --session 12123111111 --user John --verbose
```

</details>

#### Search Functionality

<details>
<summary>Click to expand search functionality details</summary>

The chat interface uses a sophisticated hybrid search approach that combines vector similarity with text matching:

1. **Vector Search**:
 Uses OpenAI's embeddings to find semantically similar content

2. **Text Search**:
 Enhances results with keyword matching for better precision

3. **Hybrid Approach**:
 Combines both methods to provide the most relevant results


This approach ensures that even when vector similarity might not find exact matches, the text search component can still retrieve relevant information. The system automatically adjusts the search strategy based on the query type and available content.
</details>

#### Persistent Conversation History

<details>
<summary>Click to expand conversation history details</summary>

The chat interface stores all conversation history in the database, allowing the LLM to remember previous interactions. This enables more natural and contextual conversations over time.

Key features:
- **Session-based conversations**:
 Each conversation gets a unique session ID

- **User identification**:
 Optionally associate conversations with specific users

- **Conversation continuity**:
 Continue conversations where you left off, even after restarting

- **Chat commands**:
  - Type `clear` to clear the conversation history
  - Type `history` to view the conversation history
  - Type `exit` or `bye` or `exit` to quit the chat interface

**Important**:
 To maintain the same conversation across multiple chat sessions, you must use the same session ID. The session ID is displayed when you start the chat interface. You can specify it before starting a new chat session:

```bash
# Start a new chat session
python chat.py --user Joe
# Note the session ID displayed (e.g., "Session ID: a24b6b72-e526-4a09-b662-0f85e82f78a7")

# Later, continue the same conversation by specifying the session ID
python chat.py --user Joe --session a24b6b72-e526-4a09-b662-0f85e82f78a7
```

You can also set a default session ID in your `.env` file:

```bash
CHAT_SESSION_ID=your-session-id
```

This way, the chat interface will always use the same session ID unless you explicitly specify a different one with the `--session` parameter.
</details>

#### User Preferences and Memory

<details>
<summary>Click to expand user preferences and memory details</summary>

The chat interface can remember user preferences and information shared during conversations, as long as you use the same session ID. For example:
- If you tell the assistant "I like Corvettes" in one session
- Then in a later session (using the same session ID), ask "What cars do I like?"
- The assistant will remember and respond with "You like Corvettes"

This memory persistence works by:
1. Storing all messages in the database with the session ID
2. Analyzing conversation history when relevant questions are asked
3. Extracting user preferences and information from previous messages

To get the most out of this feature, always use the same session ID and user ID when you want the assistant to remember previous conversations.

#### Managing User Preferences via CLI

The chat interface includes several commands for managing user preferences directly from the command line:

**Viewing Preferences**

```bash
preferences
```

Displays a table of all active preferences for the current user, including ID, type, value, confidence, context, and last used timestamp.

**Adding Preferences**

```bash
add preference <type> <value> [confidence]
```

Manually adds a new preference for the current user. If confidence is not specified, it defaults to 0.9.

Examples:

```bash
add preference like Python
add preference expertise JavaScript 0.85
add preference goal "Learn machine learning"
```

**Deleting Preferences**

```bash
delete preference <id>
```

Deletes a specific preference by ID.

**Clearing All Preferences**

```bash
clear preferences
```

Deletes all preferences for the current user after confirmation.

**Important**: 
Preference commands are only available when a user ID is provided (using `--user` when starting the chat).

</details>

### Chat Profiles

<details>
<summary>Click to expand chat profiles details</summary>

The chat interface supports different profiles that customize the behavior of the assistant. Each profile has its own system prompt, search settings, and site filtering capabilities. So ideally crawl the sitemap for a doc site and then use or create a profile with an additional system prompt to be an expert about those docs.

Built-in profiles:
- **default**:
 General-purpose assistant that searches all sites

- **pydantic**:
 Specialized for Pydantic documentation, focusing on technical details and code examples

- **technical**: 
Provides detailed technical explanations with step-by-step instructions

- **concise**:
 Gives brief, to-the-point answers without unnecessary details


You can switch profiles during a chat session:

```bash
profile pydantic
```

Or start with a specific profile:

```bash
python main.py chat --profile technical
```

You can also view all available profiles:

```bash
profiles
```

</details>

#### How Site Filtering Works

<details>
<summary>Click to expand site filtering details</summary>

The `sites` array in each profile's `search_settings` controls which sites the assistant searches through when answering questions:

```yaml
search_settings:
  sites: ["pydantic"]  # Only search in sites with "pydantic" in the name
  threshold: 0.6
  limit: 8
```

Here's how the filtering works:

1. **Empty array (`sites: []`)**:
 Searches across ALL sites in the database

2. **Site patterns**: 
Filters to only include sites where the site name contains any of the specified patterns

3. **Pattern matching**:
 Uses case-insensitive partial matching, so `"bigsk1"` would match site names like "Bigsk1 Com", "bigsk1.com", etc.

4. **Multiple patterns**: 
You can include multiple patterns to search across several related sites

The filtering process:
- When a user asks a question, the system looks at the current profile's `sites` setting
- It queries the `crawl_sites` table to find site IDs where the name contains any of the patterns
- It then only searches for content in pages associated with those site IDs
- This allows profiles to focus on specific content sources, making responses more relevant
</details>

You can switch profiles during a chat session:

```bash
profile pydantic
```

Or start with a specific profile:
```bash
python main.py chat --profile technical
```

You can also view all available profiles:

```bash
profiles
```

#### Custom Profiles

<details>
<summary>Click to expand custom profiles details</summary>

You can create your own custom profiles by adding YAML files to the `profiles` directory. Each profile file should include:

- `name`: The name of the profile (used to select it)
- `description`: A brief description of the profile
- `system_prompt`: The system prompt that defines the assistant's behavior
- `search_settings`: Configuration for search behavior
  - `sites`: List of site name patterns to filter by (empty list means search all sites)
  - `threshold`: Similarity threshold for vector search (0-1)
  - `limit`: Maximum number of results to return

Example profile file (`profiles/custom_expert.yaml`):

```yaml
name: custom_expert
description: Custom expert for specific documentation
system_prompt: |
  You are an expert on [specific topic].
  
  Your expertise includes:
  - [Area of expertise 1]
  - [Area of expertise 2]
  - [Area of expertise 3]
  
  When answering questions:
  - [Instruction 1]
  - [Instruction 2]
  - [Instruction 3]

search_settings:
  sites: ["site1", "site2"]  # Only search in sites containing these terms
  threshold: 0.6  # Higher threshold for more precise matches
  limit: 8  # Number of results to return
```

You can specify a custom profiles directory:

```bash
python main.py chat --profiles-dir my_profiles
```

</details>

#### Configuration via .env

<details>
<summary>Click to expand .env configuration details</summary>

You can set default values for the chat interface in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Chat Configuration
CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4o
CHAT_RESULT_LIMIT=5
CHAT_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.5
CHAT_SESSION_ID=default-session
CHAT_USER_ID=default-user
CHAT_PROFILE=default
CHAT_PROFILES_DIR=profiles
CHAT_VERBOSE=false
```

This allows you to maintain consistent settings and continue the same conversation across multiple sessions.
</details>

### Resetting the database

<details>
<summary>Click to expand Resetting the database</summary>
If you want to start fresh and delete all data or recreate the tables, you can use the `reset_database.py` script:

```bash
python tests/reset_database.py
```

This script provides two options:
1. Delete all data (keep tables) - This will delete all data from the tables but keep the table structure.
2. Drop and recreate tables - This will drop the tables and recreate them, effectively starting from scratch.
</details>

### Programmatic usage

You can also use the crawler programmatically in your own Python code. See `tests/example.py` for a demonstration.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/629345d4-3dea-489b-be0e-65cb07f53d9a)


The project uses the following tables in the Supabase database:

1. `crawl_sites`: Stores information about the sites you've crawled
   - `id`: Primary key
   - `name`: Name of the site
   - `url`: URL of the site
   - `description`: Optional description of the site
   - `created_at`: Timestamp when the site was added

2. `crawl_pages`: Stores the actual content, embeddings, titles, and summaries for each page
   - `id`: Primary key
   - `site_id`: Foreign key referencing the `crawl_sites` table
   - `url`: URL of the page (unique)
   - `title`: Title of the page
   - `content`: Content of the page
   - `summary`: Summary of the page
   - `embedding`: Vector embedding of the content
   - `metadata`: Additional metadata about the page
   - `is_chunk`: Boolean indicating if this is a chunk of a larger page
   - `chunk_index`: Index of the chunk within the parent page
   - `parent_id`: Foreign key referencing the parent page
   - `created_at`: Timestamp when the page was added
   - `updated_at`: Timestamp when the page was last updated

3. `chat_conversations`: Stores conversation history for the chat interface
   - `id`: Primary key
   - `session_id`: Unique identifier for the conversation session
   - `user_id`: Optional identifier for the user
   - `timestamp`: Timestamp when the message was sent
   - `role`: Role of the message sender (user, assistant, system)
   - `content`: Content of the message
   - `metadata`: Additional metadata about the message

When you crawl a site multiple times, the system will update existing pages rather than creating duplicates, ensuring you always have the most recent content. Similarly, the chat interface will maintain conversation history across sessions, allowing for more natural and contextual interactions.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26e7681b-7835-4bc3-9d64-08f2d314f77f)


![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85388083-a1d0-4054-8913-e67c6c1fb90e)

The project includes a powerful Streamlit-based Supabase Explorer app that allows you to interactively explore and analyze your database. This tool makes it easy to run SQL queries, visualize results, and gain insights from your crawled data.

### Features

- **Interactive Query Interface**:
 Run predefined or custom SQL queries with a single click

- **Data Visualization**:
 Create bar charts, line charts, and pie charts from your query results

- **Database Overview**:
 View statistics about your database, including site counts and page distribution

- **Export Functionality**:
 Download query results as CSV files for further analysis

- **Predefined Queries**:
 Access a comprehensive collection of useful SQL queries organized by category:

  - Site queries
  - Page queries
  - Chunk queries
  - Metadata queries
  - Conversation history queries
  - Statistics queries
  - Embedding analysis queries
  - Content quality queries
  - Advanced conversation analysis
  - Performance queries
  - Search performance analysis

### Running the Supabase Explorer

To launch the Supabase Explorer:

```bash
cd supabase_explorer
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run supabase_explorer.py
```

The app will automatically connect to your Supabase database using the credentials in your root `.env` file.

#### Running Supabase Explorer in Docker

The Supabase Explorer is also available as part of the Docker setup. When you run either of the Docker Compose configurations, the Streamlit app will be accessible at:

```bash
http://localhost:8501
```

This allows you to explore your database directly from the Docker container without having to install Streamlit locally.

```bash
# Start the Docker containers including the Supabase Explorer
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Or with the integrated Crawl4AI setup
docker-compose -f docker/crawl4ai-docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Adding Custom Queries

<details>
<summary>Click to expand Adding Custom Queries</summary>

You can add your own custom queries to the predefined list by editing the `supabase_explorer/supabase_queries.md` file. Follow the existing format:

```markdown
Your Category

Your Query Name

```sql
SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE your_condition;
```


After adding your queries, restart the Streamlit app to load the new queries.
</details>



## Docker Deployment - 3 different options! 

- Use the docker compose file to start the app
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a56cf708-dfe5-4aa7-a854-0685867cee18)


- If terminal is your thing then you can also just exec into the container
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be41b857-47ca-4804-97e2-98764a270748)



```bash
# Build and start the container
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f
```

This setup includes:

- API backend on port 8001
- Frontend UI on port 3000
- Streamlit Explorer on port 8501

---

### Integrated Crawl4AI Docker Deployment

If you want to run both the API and Crawl4AI in Docker containers, this is when you already have a supabase locally or externally, you can use the provided `crawl4ai-docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
# Build and start both containers
docker-compose -f docker/crawl4ai-docker-compose.yml up -d

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker/crawl4ai-docker-compose.yml logs -f
```

This setup will:
1. Start a Crawl4AI container using the official image from Docker Hub
2. Start your API container with the correct configuration to connect to Crawl4AI
3. Start the frontend UI container for the web interface
4. Start the Streamlit Explorer for database exploration
5. Create a network for the containers to communicate with each other

Make sure your `.env` file in root includes the necessary Crawl4AI configuration:

```env
# Crawl4AI Configuration
CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN=your_crawl4ai_api_token
# This will be automatically set to the Docker service name in the container
# CRAWL4AI_BASE_URL=http://crawl4ai:11235
```

Access the services:
- API: http://localhost:8001
- Frontend UI: http://localhost:3000
- Streamlit Explorer: http://localhost:8501
- Crawl4AI: http://localhost:11235

### Full Stack Docker Setup (Supabase + API + Crawl4AI + Frontend)

We provide a comprehensive Docker setup that includes everything you need to run the entire application stack:

- Supa Chat API Backend
- Frontend UI
- Supabase Docker images (Database, Kong, Realtime, etc.)
- Crawl4AI Docker image for web crawling

This setup comes with everything you need to run the complete application without any external dependencies.

<details>
<summary>Click to expand more images of the UI</summary>

#### Important Environment Variable Configuration

The full-stack Docker setup requires careful configuration of environment variables:

1. **SUPABASE_URL**: 
This should be commented out or left empty to ensure the API connects directly to the database:

```bash
# SUPABASE_URL=http://kong:8002
```
   
   If this is set, the API will try to connect to Kong for database operations, which will cause SSL negotiation errors.

2. **Direct Database Connection**:
 Ensure these database connection parameters are set correctly:

```bash
SUPABASE_HOST=db
SUPABASE_PORT=5432
SUPABASE_KEY=supabase_admin
SUPABASE_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
```

#### Setting Up the Full Stack

To use the full stack Docker setup:

1. Navigate to the docker directory:

   ```bash
   cd docker
   ```

2. Run the setup script to create necessary configuration files:

   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_update.sh
   ./setup_update.sh
   ```
   
   This script will:
   - Check for the existence of the `.env` file
   - Create SQL scripts for database initialization
   - Download Supabase initialization scripts
   - Create application tables and functions
   - Generate the Kong configuration file

3. Edit the Docker-specific `.env` file with your actual values:

   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```

4. Start the services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f full-stack-compose.yml up -d
   ```

5. Access the services:

   - API: http://localhost:8001
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8001/docs
   - Frontend UI: http://localhost:3000
   - Supabase Studio: http://localhost:3001 (username: supabase, password: from your .env file)
   - Kong API Gateway: http://localhost:8002
   - Crawl4AI: http://localhost:11235

6. Monitor or manage the stack:

   ```bash
   # Check status of all services
   ./status.sh
   
   # Reset the stack (removes all data)
   ./reset.sh
   ```

#### Troubleshooting

1. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - If you see SSL negotiation errors, make sure `SUPABASE_URL` is commented out or empty in your `.env` file
   - Verify the database credentials in the `.env` file
   - Restart the API service after making changes:

     ```bash
     docker-compose -f full-stack-compose.yml restart api
     ```

2. **REST Service Issues**:
   - If the REST service is not connecting properly, run the fix script:

     ```bash
     ./fix_rest.sh
     ```

3. **Checking Logs**:
   - View logs for a specific service:

     ```bash
     docker logs supachat-api
     docker logs supachat-kong
     docker logs supachat-frontend
     ```
