# Agentic Workflows with n8n

Harnessing the power of AI is no longer reserved for those with advanced coding skills or vast infrastructure budgets. With tools like [n8n](https://n8n.io/), a powerful open-source workflow automation platform, you can orchestrate agentic AI workflows that combine the flexibility of logic-based automation with the intelligence of modern LLMs. Whether you're a developer, data scientist, or tech-savvy entrepreneur, n8n puts AI-powered orchestration at your fingertipsâ€”especially when you self-host.

## Why Agentic Workflows?

Agentic workflows go beyond simple, linear automations. They empower AI agents to make decisions, interact with APIs, process data, and even trigger cryptocurrency transactions autonomously. Imagine a system where, based on real-time market data, an AI agent can execute trades, notify stakeholders, and update dashboardsâ€”all without manual intervention.

> **Note:** Agentic workflows are the backbone of advanced automations, enabling systems to adapt, respond, and evolve with your business needs.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Dynamic Decision-Making:** Agents can choose paths based on context.
- **Reduced Human Intervention:** Let AI handle repetitive or complex tasks.
- **Seamless Integration:** Orchestrate across cloud, on-premises, and blockchain environments.

## Why Use n8n for AI Orchestration?

n8n is more than just another workflow automation tool. Its node-based, visual interface and open-source ethos make it uniquely suited for building, customizing, and scaling agentic AI workflows.

### Features That Stand Out

| Feature           | Description                                                      |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Visual Builder**| Drag-and-drop workflow creation, perfect for rapid prototyping.  |
| **Extensibility** | Integrate any REST API, GraphQL, or use custom JavaScript nodes. |
| **Deep Integration** | 400+ prebuilt integrations, including OpenAI, Slack, crypto APIs. |
| **Self-Hosting**  | Full control over your data, security, and scaling.              |

n8nâ€™s modularity lets you create intricate workflowsâ€”think AI agents that ingest market data, run analysis with OpenAI, and post results to Discord or trigger blockchain transactions.

## Building an AI Agent Workflow in n8n


1. **Trigger:** Webhook or scheduled event starts the process.
2. **Data Gathering:** Fetch real-time data from a cryptocurrency API.
3. **AI Processing:** Pass data to an LLM (e.g., OpenAI node) for analysis or decision-making.
4. **Conditional Logic:** Use IF nodes to branch workflows based on AI output.
5. **Action:** Send alerts, update a database, or execute a smart contract.

## Self-Hosting n8n: Why and How

### Why Self-Host?

- **Privacy:** Your data stays on your servers.
- **Customization:** Install custom nodes, plugins, or AI models.
- **No Usage Limits:** Avoid cloud-based rate limits or vendor lock-in.
- **Cost Control:** Manage compute resources as you scale.


Self-hosting n8n is straightforward, especially with Docker.


Once self-hosted, you can:

- **Connect to Local AI Models:** Route requests to your own LLM endpoints.
- **On-Premises Data:** Move sensitive data without exposing it to external SaaS providers.
- **Custom Agents:** Build, fork, or share agentic workflows with your team or the open-source community.
